# Websockets Rooms
Yes, Socket.IO automatically manages the lifecycle of rooms. When there are no more clients in a room, Socket.IO will automatically "destroy" it (remove it from memory). This happens behind the scenes without you needing to implement any cleanup logic.
Here's how it works:

When a client joins a room with client.join('someRoom'), Socket.IO adds that room to its internal tracking
When a client leaves a room with client.leave('someRoom') or disconnects, Socket.IO removes that client from the room
When the last client leaves a room, Socket.IO automatically removes the room from memory
No explicit "destroy" method is needed - rooms with no clients simply cease to exist

This behavior makes Socket.IO rooms very efficient for your use case, since:

You don't need to track which rooms exist
You don't need to implement cleanup logic
Memory usage remains efficient even with many potential resources
The same room name can be reused later if new clients become interested in that resource

This automatic lifecycle management is one of the reasons why Socket.IO rooms are well-suited for your requirement of broadcasting messages only to clients interested in a specific resourceId.




















When testing with Postman:

Connect to your WebSocket with Postman (no special parameters needed yet)
After connecting, send a message to subscribe to a specific resource:

jsonCopy{
"event": "watch-resource",
"data": {
"resourceId": "id101"
}
}

Then, to simulate a message about that resource:

jsonCopy{
"event": "channels",
"data": {
"id": "someId1",
"feature": "check-ins",
"subFeature": "check-in",
"resourceId": "id101",
"message": "User 1 is typing"
}
}
This approach:

Makes clients join a room specific to each resourceId they want to watch
Broadcasts messages only to clients in the room corresponding to the resourceId
Keeps the implementation simple and scalable

The key point is that clients explicitly join rooms for resources they're interested in, and messages are only broadcast to the relevant room.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.WFare the rooms managed by socker it? when there are no more clients it will destroy it?EditYes, Socket.IO automatically manages the lifecycle of rooms.
